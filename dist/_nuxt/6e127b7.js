Result will vary widely depending on monster type. We can, at best, try some approximations - and we are doing this with a very limited sample.</div><div><br /><b>Second</b>: 5e damage is about twice as high, as predicted. HD follows a similar pattern... but not always. HP is about three times higher.</div><div><br /><b>Third</b>: AC is a bit lower in 5e (about one point), and the attack bonuses a bit higher (about two points).&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>So, my first guess was about right, except 5e HP is higher than expected. But there seems to be an easier way to fix that.</div><div><br /><b>Just divide damage and HD by two</b>. Keep AC (or add a point if you will), but let attack bonuses, HP and saving throws be defined by HD. A monster with 5HD saves as 5th-level Fighter, etc.</div><div><br /><u><b>A bigger&nbsp;sample</b></u></div><div><br /></div><div>I was unsatisfied with the results and decided to try a bigger sample, using 5e HP as a measure of power. This might be a better idea since HD are different in 5e (2d4 HD to 2d20 HD are different things). So I started by dividing HP by 10 to find HD.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I removed the dragons because they are just too different between B/X and 2e, to a point I don\'t think you could generalize \\"OSR\\" stats.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here are some results:</div><div><br /></div><div><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><a href=\\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKVLIeCu5FjCgTkjkjQwruNMyY8sEUPKBsAbR28jvcWbnF1eFR_2RNpbePl9oZs-tCyPDbOEcWaWJ2yYAmpVbbDQ8UtLbKauRX2ekJSapp8s5-RRxLWfiJewyXD2gp4vFQQlve77vnsfuZMLRuXr_x-OAgXiKe6XkIhwjdFHW8s5nIdgePo0_xHgHpwg/s881/table.png\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\\"><img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKVLIeCu5FjCgTkjkjQwruNMyY8sEUPKBsAbR28jvcWbnF1eFR_2RNpbePl9oZs-tCyPDbOEcWaWJ2yYAmpVbbDQ8UtLbKauRX2ekJSapp8s5-RRxLWfiJewyXD2gp4vFQQlve77vnsfuZMLRuXr_x-OAgXiKe6XkIhwjdFHW8s5nIdgePo0_xHgHpwg/s16000/table.png\\" /></a></div></div><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><br /></div></div><div>As you can see, this method works reasonably well in the first group - up to 50-60 HP. AC is usually close too. From 60-100, it starts to break down - but you can can use a similar formula, maybe subtracting one HD or two and adding one or two points to AC as appropriate.</div><div><br /></div><div>After 100 HP, 5e monsters get a huge boost in HP, but not in AC. 5e PCs at these levels are not really comparable to OSR PCs (a 14th level 5e fighter might have 110 HP or more, while in B/X it would be maybe half as much), and I think monsters are hardly comparable either. If you get this far, you might be better off reverting to a number between HD/2 and HP/10.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>I think you could find a method that\'s a bit more precise than the ones mentioned above, taking HD AND HP into account at the same time... but, TBH, I don\'t think it is worth the effort, as you\'ll see below.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><u><b>Outliers and monster&nbsp;types</b></u></div><div><br /></div></div><div>Some monsters changed more than others. Notice that the earth elemental has the same HD in both versions, while the ghoul went from 2 to 5, and the 5e veteran has 9 HD while the B/X version has one to three!</div><div><br /></div><div>The dragon changed a lot from B/X to 2e, for example. I used a young red dragon in my first comparison because the \\"standard\\" in the 2e Monstrous Manual is a youngling. In B/X there is only one version (10 HD), but in the 2e MM the youngling has 15 HD, while an adult has 17 HD.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the main thing to keep in mind are <b>monster types</b>. Oozes lost lots of AC. Most humanoids NPCs are frail in the OSR, with one or two HD even for veteran warriors. Giants have lots of HP in 5e. And so on.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><b><u>Is it worth the effort? Super-simple conversion</u></b></div><div><br /></div></div><div>Given that there is no precise formula that applies equally to all monsters, as seem above, is a careful conversion worth the effort?</div><div><br /></div><div><div>I think this whole exercise is useful to learn the right \\"ballpark\\" for monsters, but it might be easier AND more precise if you just found a similar monster and adapt accordingly. For example, a Nivix Cyclops (Ravnica) has 10 HD in 5e, while a usual Cyclops has 12 HD. In OSE, a Cyclops has 13 HD. So an OSE Nivix Cyclops could start with 11 HD or so, with a few special powers.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As you notice, Cyclopes were already quite though in the B/X era.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>But if you don\'t have a similar monster (which is rare), <b>just decide where the monster fits in the HD pecking order</b>, and go from there.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Use your \\"main\\" monster manual for that. For example, this is adapted from&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/265388/Low-Fantasy-Gaming-Deluxe-Edition?affiliate_id=403100\\">Low Fantasy Gaming Deluxe Edition</a>, used as an example, but you could choose the 2e MM or OSE as you \\"main\\" monster book.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><i><b>&lt; 1 HD</b> - Bat, Giant Rat, Goblin, Kobold, Man Eating Monkey, Sprite, Stirge, Xornling</i></div><div><i><b>1 HD</b> - Dwarf, Elf, Human, Projectile Leech, Skeleton, Urgot, Wolf.</i></div><div><i><b>2 HD</b> - Centaur, Dire Rat, Giant Ant (Worker), Giant Centipede, Giant Spider, Green Slime, Horse, Serpentman (Hraarsk), Skorn, Will o’ Wisp, Zombie.</i></div><div><i><b>3 HD</b> - Boar, Dire Bat, Dire Wolf, Gargoyle, Ghoul, Giant Ant (Soldier), Giant Eagle, Harpy, Lemure, Wererat, Worm (Plague), Yellow Mould.</i></div><div><i><b>4 HD</b> - Cockatrice, Claw Toad, Doppelganger, Fire Beetle, Gelatinous Cube, Giant Lizard, Griffon, Ogre, Ogre Skeleton, Shade, Tiger.</i></div><div><i><b>5 HD</b> - Barrow Wight, Chuul, Giant Serpent, Giant Shark, Giant Wasp, Hammer Snail, Hell Hound, Sorcerer, Maelheim Terror, Manipede, Merrow, Minor Elemental, Minotaur.</i></div><div><i><b>6 HD</b> - Giant Ant (Queen), Giant Crocodile, Giant Scorpion, Grey Ooze, Hag, Imp, Owlbear, Serpentman (Ssurlock), Werewolf, Wraith.</i></div></div><div><i><b>7 HD</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Banshee, <b>Cyclops</b>, Flesh Golem, Manticore, Mummy, Ogre Mage, Sabretooth Tiger, Spectre, Troll.</i></div><div><i>Etc.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Notice that a Nivix Cyclops should have FEWER HD in LFG when compared to B/X, for example; OTOH, a LFG dragon would be much stronger (20 HD) than a B/X one (10 HD).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div><b><u>Teratogenicon</u></b></div><div><br /></div></div><div>For a completely \\"new\\" monster, just decide if it is stronger or weaker than existing ones of the same type.

Result will vary widely depending on monster type. We can, at best, try some approximations - and we are doing this with a very limited sample.</div><div><br /><b>Second</b>: 5e damage is about twice as high, as predicted. HD follows a similar pattern... but not always. HP is about three times higher.</div><div><br /><b>Third</b>: AC is a bit lower in 5e (about one point), and the attack bonuses a bit higher (about two points).&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>So, my first guess was about right, except 5e HP is higher than expected. But there seems to be an easier way to fix that.</div><div><br /><b>Just divide damage and HD by two</b>. Keep AC (or add a point if you will), but let attack bonuses, HP and saving throws be defined by HD. A monster with 5HD saves as 5th-level Fighter, etc.</div><div><br /><u><b>A bigger&nbsp;sample</b></u></div><div><br /></div><div>I was unsatisfied with the results and decided to try a bigger sample, using 5e HP as a measure of power. This might be a better idea since HD are different in 5e (2d4 HD to 2d20 HD are different things). So I started by dividing HP by 10 to find HD.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I removed the dragons because they are just too different between B/X and 2e, to a point I don\'t think you could generalize \\"OSR\\" stats.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here are some results:</div><div><br /></div><div><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><a href=\\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKVLIeCu5FjCgTkjkjQwruNMyY8sEUPKBsAbR28jvcWbnF1eFR_2RNpbePl9oZs-tCyPDbOEcWaWJ2yYAmpVbbDQ8UtLbKauRX2ekJSapp8s5-RRxLWfiJewyXD2gp4vFQQlve77vnsfuZMLRuXr_x-OAgXiKe6XkIhwjdFHW8s5nIdgePo0_xHgHpwg/s881/table.png\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\\"><img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKVLIeCu5FjCgTkjkjQwruNMyY8sEUPKBsAbR28jvcWbnF1eFR_2RNpbePl9oZs-tCyPDbOEcWaWJ2yYAmpVbbDQ8UtLbKauRX2ekJSapp8s5-RRxLWfiJewyXD2gp4vFQQlve77vnsfuZMLRuXr_x-OAgXiKe6XkIhwjdFHW8s5nIdgePo0_xHgHpwg/s16000/table.png\\" /></a></div></div><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><br /></div></div><div>As you can see, this method works reasonably well in the first group - up to 50-60 HP. AC is usually close too. From 60-100, it starts to break down - but you can can use a similar formula, maybe subtracting one HD or two and adding one or two points to AC as appropriate.</div><div><br /></div><div>After 100 HP, 5e monsters get a huge boost in HP, but not in AC. 5e PCs at these levels are not really comparable to OSR PCs (a 14th level 5e fighter might have 110 HP or more, while in B/X it would be maybe half as much), and I think monsters are hardly comparable either. If you get this far, you might be better off reverting to a number between HD/2 and HP/10.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>I think you could find a method that\'s a bit more precise than the ones mentioned above, taking HD AND HP into account at the same time... but, TBH, I don\'t think it is worth the effort, as you\'ll see below.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><u><b>Outliers and monster&nbsp;types</b></u></div><div><br /></div></div><div>Some monsters changed more than others. Notice that the earth elemental has the same HD in both versions, while the ghoul went from 2 to 5, and the 5e veteran has 9 HD while the B/X version has one to three!</div><div><br /></div><div>The dragon changed a lot from B/X to 2e, for example. I used a young red dragon in my first comparison because the \\"standard\\" in the 2e Monstrous Manual is a youngling. In B/X there is only one version (10 HD), but in the 2e MM the youngling has 15 HD, while an adult has 17 HD.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the main thing to keep in mind are <b>monster types</b>. Oozes lost lots of AC. Most humanoids NPCs are frail in the OSR, with one or two HD even for veteran warriors. Giants have lots of HP in 5e. And so on.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><b><u>Is it worth the effort? Super-simple conversion</u></b></div><div><br /></div></div><div>Given that there is no precise formula that applies equally to all monsters, as seem above, is a careful conversion worth the effort?</div><div><br /></div><div><div>I think this whole exercise is useful to learn the right \\"ballpark\\" for monsters, but it might be easier AND more precise if you just found a similar monster and adapt accordingly. For example, a Nivix Cyclops (Ravnica) has 10 HD in 5e, while a usual Cyclops has 12 HD. In OSE, a Cyclops has 13 HD. So an OSE Nivix Cyclops could start with 11 HD or so, with a few special powers.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As you notice, Cyclopes were already quite though in the B/X era.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>But if you don\'t have a similar monster (which is rare), <b>just decide where the monster fits in the HD pecking order</b>, and go from there.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Use your \\"main\\" monster manual for that. For example, this is adapted from&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/265388/Low-Fantasy-Gaming-Deluxe-Edition?affiliate_id=403100\\">Low Fantasy Gaming Deluxe Edition</a>, used as an example, but you could choose the 2e MM or OSE as you \\"main\\" monster book.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><i><b>&lt; 1 HD</b> - Bat, Giant Rat, Goblin, Kobold, Man Eating Monkey, Sprite, Stirge, Xornling</i></div><div><i><b>1 HD</b> - Dwarf, Elf, Human, Projectile Leech, Skeleton, Urgot, Wolf.</i></div><div><i><b>2 HD</b> - Centaur, Dire Rat, Giant Ant (Worker), Giant Centipede, Giant Spider, Green Slime, Horse, Serpentman (Hraarsk), Skorn, Will o’ Wisp, Zombie.</i></div><div><i><b>3 HD</b> - Boar, Dire Bat, Dire Wolf, Gargoyle, Ghoul, Giant Ant (Soldier), Giant Eagle, Harpy, Lemure, Wererat, Worm (Plague), Yellow Mould.</i></div><div><i><b>4 HD</b> - Cockatrice, Claw Toad, Doppelganger, Fire Beetle, Gelatinous Cube, Giant Lizard, Griffon, Ogre, Ogre Skeleton, Shade, Tiger.</i></div><div><i><b>5 HD</b> - Barrow Wight, Chuul, Giant Serpent, Giant Shark, Giant Wasp, Hammer Snail, Hell Hound, Sorcerer, Maelheim Terror, Manipede, Merrow, Minor Elemental, Minotaur.</i></div><div><i><b>6 HD</b> - Giant Ant (Queen), Giant Crocodile, Giant Scorpion, Grey Ooze, Hag, Imp, Owlbear, Serpentman (Ssurlock), Werewolf, Wraith.</i></div></div><div><i><b>7 HD</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Banshee, <b>Cyclops</b>, Flesh Golem, Manticore, Mummy, Ogre Mage, Sabretooth Tiger, Spectre, Troll.</i></div><div><i>Etc.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Notice that a Nivix Cyclops should have FEWER HD in LFG when compared to B/X, for example; OTOH, a LFG dragon would be much stronger (20 HD) than a B/X one (10 HD).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div><b><u>Teratogenicon</u></b></div><div><br /></div></div><div>For a completely \\"new\\" monster, just decide if it is stronger or weaker than existing ones of the same type.

There are an increasing number of cards in a category I’d like to call “Support”. At the show, I met some amazing women who experienced tragedy and went on to create cards that would help others going through difficult times. Often, people don’t know what to do or say to someone when a loved one has passed, or has gotten a cancer diagnosis, or is having difficulty conceiving. I really appreciate the variety of cards being made that helps people feel loved and supported while also helping people get past their feelings of awkwardness or helplessness around these situations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/006a8f07-dda9-487f-b780-4a06813a2422/noble.jpg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n          <figcaption class=\\"image-caption-wrapper\\">\\n            <p class=\\"\\"><em>Through these cards, </em><a href=\\"https://www.thenoblepaperie.com\\"><em>The Noble Paperie</em></a><em> aims to “support those struggling through miscarriage, loss, infertility, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stays, and complicated pregnancies”.</em></p>\\n          </figcaption>\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/5b1c3099-88f7-47ca-936a-e18a0456b6b6/noble+1.jpg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n          <figcaption class=\\"image-caption-wrapper\\">\\n            <p class=\\"\\"><em>There is also a line of LGBTQ+ inclusive cards - I especially love this one!</em></p>\\n          </figcaption>\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/54b8be47-4247-4927-9825-a549a2c16434/fivedot.jpg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n          <figcaption class=\\"image-caption-wrapper\\">\\n            <p class=\\"\\"><em>Cards from </em><a href=\\"https://www.fivedotpost.com\\"><em>Five Dot Post</em></a><em> whose creator lost her husband to cancer.</em></p>\\n          </figcaption>\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/a3c87b91-733b-43ef-81a0-a8567734e698/fivedot+1.jpg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n          <figcaption class=\\"image-caption-wrapper\\">\\n            <p class=\\"\\"><em>I plan on ordering </em><a href=\\"https://www.fivedotpost.com/product-page/lung-cancer-can-suck-it-funny-get-well-card\\"><em>this card from Five Dot Post</em></a><em> and a couple others for a friend who is undergoing treatment for lung cancer.</em></p>\\n          </figcaption>\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n<p>While most of the products were greeting cards, there were definitely other cool items at the show too!

Seems like this would be a natural match for shops that carry stationery and cards. I wouldn’t expect to see the typical pen show vendor but maybe Pilot could sell their G2s or Tombow could carry markers? Just a thought.</p><p>A huge Thank You to Jeremy for helping me get a pass to this show and for letting me tag along. I don’t have pictures of this but it was fun watching Jeremy go through the process of picking out what cards he wanted to carry at Flax.

It\'s a simple hardcover notebook with a pocket on the inside back cover, an elastic strap to keep it closed, and a couple of bookmark ribbons for keeping your place. It even has a couple of index pages at the front, and every page is clearly numbered in the bottom outside corner of each page. So far, I could be describing any number of notebooks you could buy today.

The Recorder uses an 80gsm paper that Endless have coined \\"Regalia.\\" It\'s a smooth, white paper that feels great to write on. It\'s a little on the \\"too smooth\\" side for me, which means the paper doesn\'t provide as much grit or tactile feedback on the writing instrument I\'m using. It\'s not bad, and I get used to the unique smoothness the more I use it. The dot grid pattern on my unit is exactly what I expect — it\'s a light gray ink and spaced well. </p><p>With the fountain pens I used on this paper, they all behaved well when writing. The colors were bright and the ink was sharp, with no feathering in sight. This is great since the marketing tout this paper as one that won\'t bleed or feather. Show through on the back of the page is also minimal, which isn\'t always the case with paper that has an 80gsm density. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/1234a455-f6ad-475e-870b-25d418852fb1/2023-04-30_JLA7958.jpeg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n<p>On top of all that, this paper is acid free, which means your writings and doodles should last as long as the paper. In my first few writing sessions, I was happy with how the paper was performing. But then I started noticing something — it was really easy to smudge if I wasn\'t careful about where I put my fingers or hands while writing. </p><p>As I started noticing more and more smudges, I became more curious. Once I was focused on it, I realized that every fountain pen ink I used on this paper took a really long time to dry to a point that it resisted smudging. Even then, some inks seem to smudge even after they look completely dry. Interesting. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/009e6b29-28b8-414c-8545-6576ce78fc2e/2023-04-30_JLA7960.jpeg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n<p>After a little more testing, I discovered that other pens produced similar results. Gel ink, rollerball ink, and some ballpoint inks all smudged slightly if you rubbed over them with your finger or hand. Not great! Whatever coating they use to make the paper ultra smooth has a terrible side effect: super long dry times. </p><p>This was a bummer because I realized that my writing style is the best case scenario. If you\'re left handed, this paper is a non-starter. I was even more bummed when I came back to a page that I had written <em>24 hours before</em> and confirmed that it was still extremely easy to smudge if I lightly dragged a finger over it. Wow. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/bf75ff4a-07ff-447f-bcd8-844031f073af/2023-04-30_JLA7951.jpeg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n<p>To add insult to injury, the marketing on the packaging for this notebook states \\"World\'s most ink-friendly notebook.\\" I get that marketing materials have a certain level of hyperbole — that\'s just how the industry works. But in this case, it\'s not even in the best tier of ink-friendly papers. With the way it prevents ink from fully drying, this notebook goes straight to bottom of the list for me. I\'d pick up a Moleskine before this one because at least the Moleskine would let my ink dry in a reasonable amount of time (albeit with lots of feathering and show-through!). </p>\\n<p>The Recorder is available in several colors and paper ruling styles for $23.50.

When a unit attacks a monster or other units, it doesn\'t make an attack roll. Instead, it simply roll for damage. The damage caused by a score every turn is equal to the damage caused by an individual multiplied by [21-THAC0+AC].</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><b><i>Unit damage = single damage * [21-THAC0+AC]</i></b></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">An unit of veterans, for example, causes 1d8 * [2+AC]. Against a target with AC 4, they cause 6d8 damage per round.</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">If you\'re using ascending AC and attack bonus (AB) instead of THAC0, the formula is NPC DMG*(21+AB-AC). The results are exactly the same (e.g., the veterans cause 6d8 damage, etc.).</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">If you want units of 100, 200 or 1000, just multiply the damage by 5, 10 or 50 as appropriate.</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">Smaller units should divide damage as appropriate (e.g., an unit of 10 NPCs deals half damage - 3d8 in our example). One possibility could be just attacking as normal until you\'re reduced to 10 NPCS, and only then reduce damage by half.</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">Units of 13 or 17 are possible but the math gets harder: roll damage, divide by 20 and multiply by 13 or 17. You can use approximations if you want (e.g., an unit of 6 or 7 just deal one third of the original damage), move on to the freeform system, or fall back to individual attacks when there are few NPCs left.</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">---</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><u style=\\"font-weight: 700;\\">1b) The freeform system</u></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">In the freeform system, the damage of an unit is equal to the sum of all individual damage, <b>averaged and divided by three</b>. For an unit of 20 veterans, it would be 30, for example (20d8, average 90, divided by 3).</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><b>To hit, simply make three separate attack rolls. </b>Each successful attack inflicts 30 points of damage.&nbsp;</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">Three is an arbitrary number, of course - you might as well divide the total damage by ten or twenty and roll as many dice, but three attack are enough for me.</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">If you lose about a third of your unit and don\'t want to recalculate, you could reduce to two attacks instead. However, recalculating is very easy even without a calculator (17 veterans cause 17d8 damage, a bit less than 6d8 when divided by three, so let\'s say about 25 damage per attack) - or, if you prefer, calculate (or even roll 6d8) after you hit.</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">---</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><b><u>2) Taking damage</u></b></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">When an unit takes damage, just divide it evenly to see how many NPCs are down. A group of 20 veterans (4 HP per NPC) taking 30 damage loses 7 individuals, excess damage is discarded.</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">Notice these individuals aren\'t necessarily dead, but they are out of the combat for all intents and purposes.</div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: left;\\">Single figures (e.g., a single dragon in the battlefield) loses HP as normal.

Diametrically opposed neodymium magnets rotate bidirectionally to engage and disengage the cartridge to create an unparalleled crisp click.”</p>\\n</blockquote><p>More on this in a minute.</p><p>In addition to the mechanism, it features a custom designed clip, and two extra internal pieces that form a sleeve over the refill inside the barrel, assumedly to assist with the twist mechanism and internal magnets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/a56c1ed1-c8e4-4330-a330-c87a83864c5d/IMG_9790.jpg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n<p>For a brass barrel ballpoint pen, that’s a lot. That’s a feature for Makers Cabinet. If I have learned anything, it’s that they are happy to take simple stationery goods and make them “extra.” It’s the Makers Cabinet way.</p>\\n<p>In the case of the Lazlo, I don’t think it is too extra, but it is a far more fidgety design than I hoped for.</p>\\n<p>Let’s go back to the diametrically opposed neodymium magnets used for the twist mechanism. It works, but it doesn’t work the same every time. Sometimes the twist engages the refill, sometimes it pokes it out then pops it back in, and sometimes I just overshoot the stop completely and have to keep going around to engage it again. It’s not a consistent station-to-station mechanism. It’s more like sta-tion to stati-on to st-ation. There is no consistency, other than you will eventually get to where you need to be.</p>\\n<p>Once you do, the writing experience, well, I had to enlist the help of my wife to capture this (volume on):</p>\\n\\n<p>If I wanted a typewriter, I would have bought a typewriter. Wow, that is a lot of tip rattle. Now, I’m not going to knock them too hard for this, but for a company that prides themselves on their design work, I would think they would have better mitigation of this known issue with a metal refill on a metal barrel. It’s going to happen. How you deal with it says a lot. For Makers Cabinet, there is no dealing with it.</p><p>The aftermarket fix is simple, just a little tape around the refill to serve as a shock absorber inside the barrel will do the trick. An internal o-ring on the refill, possibly added by the company before shipping, would help, too.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n    \\n  \\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n        <figure class=\\"\\n              sqs-block-image-figure\\n              intrinsic\\n            \\">\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n                  <img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"thumb-image\\" src=\\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5005c8fc84ae929b37214ebd/a5da139e-5e10-4908-8e6b-b49697ef0d80/IMG_9789.jpg?format=1000w\\" />\\n                \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        \\n      \\n        </figure>\\n      \\n\\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n<p>Neither of those issues are deal breakers for me. They work, eventually, or there is a work around. The clip falls into this category as well, and I think it is the weakest design element of the bunch. In a literal sense, it is too flimsy for a pen this heavy. This is a full brass barrel, checking in at 66 grams (a standard Retro 51 rollerball is 28 grams, for comparison,) and this is a thin, stamped metal, clip that doesn’t even lock down to the barrel. It’s probably a better fit for the aluminum barrel model of the Lazlo, where it is a better balanced option. (<strong>Update:</strong> <em>Makers Cabinet reached out to me via Instagram and said they will be updating the clip for the Lazlo V2, and will provide a retrofit option for this model as well.</em>)</p>\\n<p>If your plans are to use this as a heavy duty EDC pen, which is what its style and choice of pressurized refill dictates, I’d worry about how quick the clip would fail.

But I also think it is fair to point out when a company that prides itself on unique designs and ideas falls short, even if it is only a little bit here and there.

A Halfling can\\nmulticlass into thief or fighter, thus transcending his level limit at a\\nsignificant cost.

The result is similar to&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2016/06/really-old-school-house-rules.html\\">a 1978 (!) house rule</a>.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">-&nbsp;<b>Half-races</b>.

A Halfling can\\nmulticlass into thief or fighter, thus transcending his level limit at a\\nsignificant cost. Each possibility (Halfling, Halfling-thief, Halfling-fighter)\\nhas its own strengths and weaknesses. Same for elves and dwarves. The result is similar to&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2016/06/really-old-school-house-rules.html\\">a 1978 (!) house rule</a>.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">-&nbsp;<b>Half-races</b>. Half-elf? No problem,\\njust add an human class to elf. You can combine elves and dwarves to create\\ngnomes, and so on.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">-&nbsp;<b>Three classes</b>? No problem, divide the\\nXP evenly by three.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">-&nbsp;<b>Monstrous races</b>. You could have\\nkobold, goblin, and lizardmen NPCs&nbsp; - any creature that is not remarkably\\npowerful. Just pick a class with a 50% XP tax , get the appropriate powers\\n(usually darkvision, maybe +1 damage), you don\'t even need to create anything.\\nThese are not necessarily balanced - a kobold fighter will always be weaker\\nthan a human fighter (although the kobold probably wins in the dark...) - which\\nis fine, as it keeps kobold as weaker humanoids as they are described in the\\nbooks.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">-&nbsp;<b>Dual classing</b>&nbsp;- okay, I googled\\nit. So, you could \\"multiclass\\" when you\'re already a 5th level\\nfighter, for example. I see no problem in principle - all your XP goes to your\\nnew class until it can match your current XP, and then divide it evenly when\\nboth classes reach the same XP. Also, add some downtime and in-game\\njustification for why you became a powerful mage so quickly! This is easier\\nthan most archaic, byzantine dual-classing rules.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">-&nbsp;<b>Balance</b>? This is more or less\\nbalanced in most ways I could imagine. It is far from perfect because classes\\nare not balanced to begin with. Notice, you HAVE to keep the XP division even.\\nIf you start distributing XP in some weird 75-25 split, for example, you get\\nunbalanced results.&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">For example, a 14th level MU would become a 12th\\nlevel MU who is ALSO a 9th level fighter - with his own barony!</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">Of course, this is not meant for infinite XP. Let\'s\\ntry with 1,050,000, for example - the highest in the game AFAICT.\\nThis gives us, for example:</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">- A 14th level MU.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">- A 10th-level MU who is also an 8th level\\nHalfling. No problems here.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">- A 10th-level MU who is also a 11th level fighter.\\nStill has a barony (sigh), but no MU apprentices and doesn\'t get access to\\n6th-level spells.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">- A 10th-level MU who is also a 12th level cleric.\\nDoes seem too powerful (although IMO this is a <a href=\\"https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/02/the-strange-clerics-of-original-d-and.html\\">cleric problem</a>). Probably fixable by using a single spell progression.&nbsp;You still have 5/5/4/4/3 spell slots (like every&nbsp;</span><span>12th level cleric), so you could cast four fireballs or cast striking four times - or two of each.</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">Maybe we need some different limit. Maybe 1,200,000 XP, limited to level 8 in your secondary class, disallowing multiple types of\\nstronghold, for example? Could work, thus adding even more options - a\\nMU/fighter distinct from a fighter/MU, for example.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=\\"line-height: normal; text-align: left;\\"><span lang=\\"EN-US\\"><br /></span></div><div style=\\"line-height: normal; text-align: left;\\"><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">An MU/elf abandoned other elves and might build a tower one day, but not become an elven leader; while a elf/MU still lives among elves (this redundant combination might be nearly useless, however).</span></div><div style=\\"line-height: normal; text-align: left;\\"><span lang=\\"EN-US\\"><br /></span></div><div style=\\"line-height: normal; text-align: left;\\"><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">Ability score requirements\\nstill apply, etc.</span></div><div style=\\"line-height: normal; text-align: left;\\"><span lang=\\"EN-US\\"><br /></span></div><div style=\\"line-height: normal; text-align: left;\\"><span lang=\\"EN-US\\">This gives us... <b>more than 30</b> possible combinations, even if you prohibit some of them?

These fungi have little holdfasts called haustoria that allows them to cling to the ant\'s cuticle. They are ectoparasites of insects that attach to their host\'s external surface and suck their hemolymph (insect\'s equivalent of blood). So in a way they are rather like ticks or lice (and yes, there are labouls that live on <a href=\\"http://dailyparasite.blogspot.com/2017/04/arthrorhynchus-nycteribiae.html\\">ectoparasitic insects</a>, which one might consider as a bit of poetic justice).</div><div class=\\"Ar Au Ao\\" id=\\":1cl\\"><div class=\\"Am Al editable LW-avf tS-tW tS-tY\\" hidefocus=\\"true\\" id=\\":1ch\\" style=\\"direction: ltr;\\" tabindex=\\"1\\"><br />But this fungus seems to do more than just suck the ant\'s blood, as it causes the infected ants and other ants around them to behave differently. <i>Rickia wasmannii</i> changes the host ant\'s cuticular hydrocarbon or CHC profile. CHC is essentially an ant\'s ID profile - they use it to recognise nestmates, tell each other apart, and be alerted to strangers from other nests. But <i>R. wasmannii</i> messes with that, scrambling the infected ants\' CHC profile, and making them \\"smell\\" differently to uninfected ants.<br /><br />Scientists wanted to find out how the presence of this fungus affects the way ants interact with each other. The challenge with studying ant behaviour is that when you put two ants together, it is difficult to tell apart whether the ant you are observing is responding to the other ant\'s chemical profile, or if it is responding to the way the other ant is reacting to them. The only way to get a clear observation is to present the ant with something that it would recognise as a fellow ant, but would not muddle the outcome by reacting to the ant that you are trying to observed<br /><br />The solution turns out to be freeze-killed ants. Ants that are killed in this manner retain their CHC profile, so other ants would treat them just as another live ant, but obviously a dead ant wouldn\'t react to a live ant\'s presence and confound the outcome. In addition to those freeze-killed test subjects, scientists also made ant \\"dummies\\" which are essentially blank slates in ant forms that they can imbue with whatever chemical signature they were testing. These \\"dummies\\" were made by washing ant corpses in hexane to remove their chemical signature. To ants, these specially treated ant corpses are like faceless mannequin, with no identity - until the scientist imbues them with one, by anointing them with a droplet of cuticular extract from another ant.<br /><br />When ants were presented with dummies that were smeared with the cuticular extract of ants from a different nest, the ants started biting, dragging, or stinging the dummies, much like how they would respond to a live ant from another nest. But when they were presented with either the corpse of a <i>Rickia</i>-infected ant, or dummies that \\"smell\\" like a <i>Rickia</i>-infected ant, they were more relaxed and less likely to get aggro. Furthermore, it\'s not just that the fungus made other ants act differently, the infected ant itself also starts behaving differently. Infected ants are generally less likely to pick a fight with another ant, but especially when facing other infected ants.<br /><br />As mentioned previously, <i>R. wasmannii</i> seems to change the ant\'s CHC profile, but one would think scrambling the host ant\'s profile would make other ants react <i>more</i>&nbsp;aggressively towards them since ants usually have a \\"stranger danger\\" response to ants that \\"smell\\" different to their nestmates. But the way that <i>R. wasmannii</i> changes how an ant \\"smell\\" seems to have a calming effect, and this comes down to a molecule called <b>n-C23</b> which is present in higher concentration on the cuticle of all infected ants. When the scientist presented ants with dummies that have been smeared with n-C23 and nothing else, almost all hints of aggressive behaviour ceased.<br /><br />So by increasing n-C23 concentration in its host\'s cuticle, <i>R. wasmannii</i> has unlocked a life hack that allows it to not just access all areas in an ant colony, but to spread to other nests as well. In the scientists\' study population, about half the colonies they studied had the fungus present, and in some nests, <a href=\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022201116300246\\">all the ants were infected</a> with <i>R. wasmannii</i>. A testament to the fungus\' successful manipulation of ant behaviour.<br /><br />Furthermore the fungus\' presence also affects another, very different parasite which also lives with ants - the caterpillar of <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phengaris\\">blue butterflies</a>.&nbsp;These caterpillars are social parasites that convince worker ants into adopting them into their nest. Once they are settled in, they start demanding food from the worker ants and even feed on the ant\'s developing broods. But the caterpillars don\'t seem to survive as long in nests which are already hosting <i>R. wasmannii</i>, and in the field, these two parasites co-occur less commonly than expected based on their respective prevalence, which indicates the caterpillar and the fungus are <a href=\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02800-3\\">in competition over ant real estate</a>.<br /><br />By messing with their identity and making them more chilled out, <i>R. wasmannii</i> can turn an ant colony into a fungus party.

One of the most common types of parasites that infect bivalves are <a href=\\"http://dailyparasite.blogspot.com/search/label/trematode\\">trematode</a> flukes.

Sometimes, these seemingly passive molluscs put up a fight against these tiny intruders, especially when they get into the mantle fold. And they do so by secreting calcium carbonate around the invading parasite, smothering these flukes alive - and the result of that gruesome interaction is a pearl.</div><div><br /></div><div>The study being featured in this post looked at the frequency of pearls and parasites in mussels on the northwestern Adriatic coast. The flukes that are most commonly associated with pearls there are those from the <b>Gymnophallidae</b> family, and this study focus on one particular genus - <i>Parvatrema</i>. These flukes use mussels as their intermediate host, where the larvae temporarily reside and develop until they are eaten by shorebirds - this parasite\'s final host.</div><div><br /></div><div>Out of the 158 mussels that the researchers examined, about two-thirds of them were infected, and most of the mussels had a mix of both live flukes and pearls.Their parasite load varied quite a lot, from some mussels with a few flukes, to one with over 3700 flukes. But on average, each mussel harboured about 200 flukes. The flukes were scattered throughout the mussel\'s body, but most were concentrated near the gonads, and some were found at the base of the gills. A few were squeezed in between the mantle and the shell - and it is those that are at the most risk of being turned into pearls.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of which, about half the mussels that the researchers examined had pearls of some sort in them. But there were far fewer pearls than there were flukes. Each mussel had 35 pearls on average, but they were nowhere near the size of pearls most people associate with jewellery. These pearls were about the same size as fine sand grains, but they were pearls nevertheless - complete with entombed fluke(s) in each of them.</div><div><br /></div><div>The high prevalence of <i>Parvatrema</i> in mussels from this area means that it could be risky to set up mussel farms there, at least near the coast where the parasite\'s bird hosts like to hang out. No one wants to buy mussels riddled with parasites, and while pearls are considered as valuable, the type of pearls found in these mussels only decrease their market value. That is one of the reasons why some mussel farming operation are <a href=\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12549\\">located offshore</a> where they won\'t be exposed to <i>Parvatrema</i> and other parasitic flukes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Based on the results of the study, pearl formation seems a bit hit-or-miss as a defensive mechanism. The majority of flukes get away with living rent-free in the mussels without setting off the pearly deathtraps, and it\'s not entirely clear why some of them trigger pearl formation, while most flukes are left alone. Despite this, some recent studies indicate that bivalves are not the only molluscs that can entomb their parasites that way. Some land snails are also capable of sealing away various parasites such as <a href=\\"https://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2023/01/parasite220116/parasite220116.html\\">flukes</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5500577/\\">roundworms</a> into their shell.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So it seems the molluscs have evolved a general two-in-one defensive package that can potentially protect them against both predators and parasites. While neither shell nor pearls offer guaranteed protection against predators and parasites respectively, it\'s still better than having nothing at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>Reference:</div><div>Marchiori, E., Quaglio, F., Franzo, G., Brocca, G., Aleksi, S., Cerchier, P., Cassini, R. &amp; Marcer, F.

One of the most common types of parasites that infect bivalves are <a href=\\"http://dailyparasite.blogspot.com/search/label/trematode\\">trematode</a> flukes. Some species embed themselves stubbornly in the mollsuc\'s tissue, others <a href=\\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-helminthology/article/abs/equal-partnership-two-trematode-species-not-one-manipulate-the-burrowing-behaviour-of-the-new-zealand-cockle-austrovenus-stutchburyi/118A610D1585458267A09D86456B5B7A\\">impair their ability to use parts of their body</a>, and there are even some that end up <a href=\\"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v59/n2/p151-158/\\">castrating their shellfish host</a>. Sometimes, these seemingly passive molluscs put up a fight against these tiny intruders, especially when they get into the mantle fold. And they do so by secreting calcium carbonate around the invading parasite, smothering these flukes alive - and the result of that gruesome interaction is a pearl.</div><div><br /></div><div>The study being featured in this post looked at the frequency of pearls and parasites in mussels on the northwestern Adriatic coast. The flukes that are most commonly associated with pearls there are those from the <b>Gymnophallidae</b> family, and this study focus on one particular genus - <i>Parvatrema</i>. These flukes use mussels as their intermediate host, where the larvae temporarily reside and develop until they are eaten by shorebirds - this parasite\'s final host.</div><div><br /></div><div>Out of the 158 mussels that the researchers examined, about two-thirds of them were infected, and most of the mussels had a mix of both live flukes and pearls.Their parasite load varied quite a lot, from some mussels with a few flukes, to one with over 3700 flukes. But on average, each mussel harboured about 200 flukes. The flukes were scattered throughout the mussel\'s body, but most were concentrated near the gonads, and some were found at the base of the gills. A few were squeezed in between the mantle and the shell - and it is those that are at the most risk of being turned into pearls.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of which, about half the mussels that the researchers examined had pearls of some sort in them. But there were far fewer pearls than there were flukes. Each mussel had 35 pearls on average, but they were nowhere near the size of pearls most people associate with jewellery. These pearls were about the same size as fine sand grains, but they were pearls nevertheless - complete with entombed fluke(s) in each of them.</div><div><br /></div><div>The high prevalence of <i>Parvatrema</i> in mussels from this area means that it could be risky to set up mussel farms there, at least near the coast where the parasite\'s bird hosts like to hang out. No one wants to buy mussels riddled with parasites, and while pearls are considered as valuable, the type of pearls found in these mussels only decrease their market value. That is one of the reasons why some mussel farming operation are <a href=\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12549\\">located offshore</a> where they won\'t be exposed to <i>Parvatrema</i> and other parasitic flukes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Based on the results of the study, pearl formation seems a bit hit-or-miss as a defensive mechanism. The majority of flukes get away with living rent-free in the mussels without setting off the pearly deathtraps, and it\'s not entirely clear why some of them trigger pearl formation, while most flukes are left alone. Despite this, some recent studies indicate that bivalves are not the only molluscs that can entomb their parasites that way. Some land snails are also capable of sealing away various parasites such as <a href=\\"https://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2023/01/parasite220116/parasite220116.html\\">flukes</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5500577/\\">roundworms</a> into their shell.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So it seems the molluscs have evolved a general two-in-one defensive package that can potentially protect them against both predators and parasites. While neither shell nor pearls offer guaranteed protection against predators and parasites respectively, it\'s still better than having nothing at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>Reference:</div><div>Marchiori, E., Quaglio, F., Franzo, G., Brocca, G., Aleksi, S., Cerchier, P., Cassini, R. &amp; Marcer, F.

The thing about big animals is that they provide a lot of room for parasites. The myriad array of spacious organs found in an animal like a whale provide ample opportunities for parasites to become very specialised not just on a particular species of host, but on a very specific niche within the host\'s anatomy.

There were a mix of six different whale species in total, and considering the population of parasites that each whale could support, it provided researchers with plenty of material to work with.

But out of them, the most abundant was <i>Stenurus globicephalae</i>, which was found in three host species including <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risso%27s_dolphin\\">Risso\'s Dolphin</a>, <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-finned_pilot_whale\\">Short-finned pilot whales</a>, and <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-finned_pilot_whale\\">Long-finned pilot whales</a>. Each whale harboured between 18 to over 1700 of those worms, which were mostly found in the pterygoid sinus, located deep within the nasal passage near the back of the whale\'s throat.

Each <i>Stenurus</i>&nbsp;species differ in their host preferences, and it seems to be related to how they get transmitted to the whale in the first place.
